# Parlour

A synth built on [synthkit](https://github.com/10d6/synthkit). It runs in the
browser and as a VST3 / AU plugin.

## Playing it

- **In the browser:** every PR gets a preview link (posted on the PR), and
  `main` is at the repo's GitHub Pages site.
- **In your DAW:** each PR's CI run has a **plugin-windows**, **plugin-macos**
  and **plugin-linux** download (under *Checks → CI → Summary → Artifacts*).
  Unzip it and follow `INSTALL.md` inside. Tagging a version (`v0.2.0`)
  publishes them as a release.

## Building

```
git clone --recursive <this repo>
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
./build/parlour_render --check . --out renders     # every check; WAVs into renders/
```

The browser page and the plugins are built the same way as in synthkit: see
[`synthkit/API.md`](synthkit/API.md) §11–12.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `synth.json` | identity (name, IDs, plugin codes) and kit features |
| `src/` | the sound engine |
| `presets/` | factory presets (`init.json` is what a new instance starts on) |
| `tests/` | render scenarios checked in CI |
| `ui/layout.json` | the panel layout (and `ui/custom.js` for custom widgets, `ui/style.css` for styles, or `ui/page.js` for a page of the synth's own: API.md §9a) |
| `synthkit/` | the kit, as a pinned submodule |
